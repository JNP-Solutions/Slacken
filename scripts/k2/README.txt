These scripts are originally from the Kraken 2 project by Derrick Wood et al, under the MIT license.
In some cases they have been modified for use with Slacken.

We use them in Slacken to help download taxonomies and genomes, and to mask low-complexity
regions in genomes.

For the download process to work, the kraken2 binaries must be installed and available in the path (in particular,
k2mask).

These scripts are originally from the Kraken 2 project by Derrick Wood et al, under the MIT license.
In some cases they have been modified for use with Slacken.

See: https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2

We use them in Slacken to help download taxonomies and genomes, and to mask low-complexity
regions in genomes.

For the download process to work, the kraken2 binaries must be installed and available in the path (in particular,
k2mask). Other dependencies: seqkit (https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/download/), curl.

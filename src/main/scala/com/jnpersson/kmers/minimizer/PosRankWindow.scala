package com.jnpersson.kmers.minimizer

/**
 * Tracks minimizers in a moving window, such that the top priority item can always be obtained efficiently.
 * Mutates the minimizer positions by setting valid/invalid flags. Can only be used once.
 * This class looks like an Iterator[Int], but to avoid boxing of integers, does not extend that trait.
 *
 * Invariants: the leftmost position has the highest priority (minimal rank).
 * Priority decreases (i.e. rank increases) monotonically going left to right.
 * Motifs are sorted by position.
 * The minimizer of the current k-length window is always the first motif in the list.
 *
 * @param motifRanks Array of motif priorities at the positions in the underlying read where the full motif can first
 *                   be read (e.g. position 4 for a 5-length motif occupying positions 0-4).

   * k-mer combination (reduction) rules for combining indexes.
   * Most of these support both intersection and union. An intersection is an operation that requires
   * the k-mer to be present in every input index, or it will not be present in the output. A union may preserve
   * the k-mer even if it is present in only one input index.
   * Except for the case of the union Sum reduction, indexes must be compacted prior to reduction, that is, each
   * k-mer must occur in each index with a nonzero value only once.
   *
   * These rules were inspired by the design of KMC3: https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC
